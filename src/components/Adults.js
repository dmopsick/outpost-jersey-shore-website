                    Being a healthy, fully realized adult is simple.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Eat right. Exercise. Socialize with loved ones. Keep learning. I mean, that&#8217;s like four things, how hard can it really be?
                    <br/><br/>
                    The truth is most folks struggle mightily with the one task that should be everyone&#8217;s top priority → <em>taking care of themselves</em>!
                    <br/><br/>
                    We are distracted by a million and one different agendas - the kids, the dog, our job, the car, the news, our coffee order was wrong, blah blah blah!
                    <br/><br/>
                    Add to these distractions the fact that once you do find some time to yourself for a meal or a workout, you are inundated with heavily processed foods, bullshit workouts, and a world of misinformation and salesmen peddling snake oils. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    “Well Shane, what the f*ck am I supposed to do?” … I&#8217;m glad you asked.
                    <br/><br/>
                    <b>JUST GIVE UP!</b>
                    <br/><br/>
                    ... I&#8217;m kidding.
                    <br/><br/>
                    If you have made it this far, I applaud you. I am not too annoying (yet).  
                    But ultimately it demonstrates you have visited my page <em>looking to make a change</em>. That is where it all starts - it's not the perfect workout routine or the grocery overhaul or the new Crossfit membership. 
                    It all starts with the vulnerability to admit you do not like where you are at currently, and the decision to commit to the journey of self-improvement, one little win at a time. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    We only get one crack at this life thing; why do it in pain? Why do it plagued with chronic illness? Why do it inhibited from your full potential? 
                    Why do it unable to enjoy the many wonders and joys of life, from hiking tall mountains to being able to surf with your grandkids? 
                    You owe it to yourself and your loved ones to be physically fit; it is a moral obligation. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    I am not concerned or judging where you are starting this journey from. That is not important. 
                    What matters is where we are going, and the consistent little wins we are going to stack day in and day out to keep you moving on this journey.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I believe health and wellness are for everyone, but I cannot promise that our training and coaching is for everyone. Some basic prerequisites I ask for with my clients:
                </p>
                <ul className='infoList'>
                    <li>Are over 25 years old and live in Monmouth County, NJ*</li>
                    <li>Are open to coaching and can remain optimistic in the face of feedback and challenges</li>
                    <li>Understand that results require commitments outside of a few hours in the gym each week</li>
                    <li>Minimum 1 in-person training session per week**</li>
                    <li>Are committed to making a positive change in their life, regardless of wherever they are starting from</li>
                </ul>
